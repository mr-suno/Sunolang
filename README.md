## Recent Updates 🚀
### Printing
* **Concatenation**: Link multiple strings OR numbers together
```
save string as "concatenated"

/* It's recommended you use "," if your string needs
   a space after it */

print("boom", string) // Feedback: "boom concatenation"
print("easy" + string) // Feedback: "easyconcatenation"
```

### Comments
* **Single & Multiline**: Useful for explaining code, the script ignores comments entirely
```
/* Use this type of comment
   for multiple lines! */

print("hey!") // ..and use me for a single line
```
