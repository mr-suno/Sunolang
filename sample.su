// Hey!
/* Sunolang is a VERY beginner-friendly
   and easy-use language. */

// Log our age & name:

save age as 15
save name as "Suno"

print("Hello, I'm", name, "and I'm", age, "years old.") // Feedback: "Hey! I'm Suno and I'm 15 years old."


// Another example is simply,

save half as "lang"

print("I <3 Suno", half) // Feedback: "I <3 Sunolang"
